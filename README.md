# Battle ðŸŽ®ðŸŽ®

This project was about building a battling game in pairs throughout the week using Ruby.
We learnt how to connect different elements such as players, scores and attacks in diferrent
routes of the controller. Given we did this in pairs, this was a work in progress project as
we jumped between people's projects across the week depending on thier progress.
